JNGL is a set of tools used to create graphic compositions inspired by wildstyle graffiti and the afrofuturism universe.

## TAGZ
TAGZ is a Processing sketch that uses [HYPE](https://www.hypeframework.com/), [controlP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/controlP5/) and public domain fonts to create graphic compositions that can be saved and edited.

Just like [jungle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cGvbsqghp4) took the break to new and imposible hyperythms through complex rhythmhacking processes, wildstyle graffiti transformed writing into a hypercomplex system through cryptographic processes.
